  <title>Finding Who I Am</title>

  <h1>Why write this blog?</h1>
  <p>I'm in my thirties and have no clue who I am or what I even like. I've been
    doing IT work for over a decade and never felt a connection to it. Sometimes
    people fall into situations where they find something they can do to make
    money and they just go with it. I've found through discussions with others
    and my own experience that over time this breeds discontent and depression.
    <br>
    If you have found something you love and that's what you do, great. I am happy
    for you. I know that may sound like a sarcastic, back-handed throw-away type
    of comment but it's not. I'm happy for you. Everyone really does deserve a chance to be happy.
    I am glad you found it.
    <br>
    Unfortunately that is not the case for me. So I've started this blog to chronicle my experiences.
    Mainly it will be learning coding/scripting, writing, and baking.
    I won't be writing about politics or any of that stuff. This isn't for that.
    I might write some things about issues that people may face where, hopefully,
    my experience may help someone else going through the same.
    <br>
    That's the basic idea here. Hopefully you enjoy what you see. If you have
    any comments, suggestions, or just want to talk then feel free to email me
